# SydKick

AI Assistant that is right there when you need it.

SydKick is a Desktop application designed to enhance your productivity by bringing AI assistance directly to your screen. You can download the App from the [Website](https://sydkick.ai)

## Why is SydKick Cool?

- SydKick is voice conversation first. So you don't have to type, instead, just speak naturally and the AI will respond
- You can effortlessly give SydKick context for any question by sharing your screen with the click of a button when asking. Once the button is released, SydKick doesn't see your screen anymore.
- You can decide when to or when not to let SydKick see your screen.
